A lightweight Windows utility for players of Elite Dangerous. It monitors your in-game cargo in real-time, displaying the contents and total count in a simple interface and exporting the data to a text file for use with streaming overlays or other tools.

---

## üìç Overview

This tool provides a simple way to keep an eye on your ship's cargo without having to tab into the game's right-hand panel. It reads the `Cargo.json` file that Elite Dangerous generates, along with player journals to determine total capacity. The output is displayed in the app window and also written to a `cargo.txt` file, which is perfect for adding a cargo display to your stream via OBS or other broadcasting software.

-   **Simple UI**: A clean, no-fuss window displays your current cargo list.
-   **Text File Output**: Exports cargo data to `out/cargo.txt` for easy integration with other tools (like OBS for streaming).
