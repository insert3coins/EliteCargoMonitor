A lightweight Windows utility for players of Elite Dangerous. It monitors your in-game cargo in real-time, displaying the contents and total count in a simple interface and exporting the data to a text file for use with streaming overlays or other tools.

---

## üìç Overview

This tool provides a simple way to keep an eye on your ship's cargo and status without having to tab into the game's right-hand panel. It reads the `Cargo.json`, `Status.json`, and player journal files to display your cargo, credit balance, CMDR name, and current ship. The output is displayed in a clean interface that includes a real-time cargo list, a visual meter for your cargo hold, and an indicator to show when monitoring is active. The data is also written to a `cargo.txt` file, which is perfect for adding a cargo display to your stream via OBS or other broadcasting software.

1.  Go to the **Releases** page.
2.  Download the `.zip` file from the latest release.
3.  Extract the contents to a folder of your choice.
4.  Run `EliteCargoMonitor.exe`.

### Building from Source

If you want to build the project yourself:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/insert3coins/EliteCargoMonitor.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd EliteCargoMonitor
    ```
3.  Restore the .NET dependencies:
    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```
4.  Run the application:

    dotnet run
    ```

## ü§ñ Usage

1.  Launch Elite Dangerous.
2.  Run `EliteCargoMonitor.exe`.
3.  Click **Start** to begin monitoring.
4.  The application window will update whenever your cargo changes.
5.  A file named `cargo.txt` (by default) will be created and updated in the configured output directory (by default, an `out` sub-folder). You can add this text file as a source in OBS.
6.  Click **Stop** to pause monitoring.
7.  Minimize or close the window to send the application to the system tray. You can restore it by double-clicking the tray icon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

You can customize the application's behavior by clicking the **Settings** button.

### Enable File Output

You can enable or disable the creation of the output text file. This is useful if you only want to use the application's UI and don't need the file for streaming overlays. By default, this is disabled.

### Output File Format

You can change the format of the text written to the output file using a custom format string. The following placeholders are available:

-   `{count}`: Total number of items in cargo.
-   `{capacity}`: Total cargo capacity (blank if not yet known).
-   `{count_slash_capacity}`: A combined view, e.g., "128/256" or just "128".
-   `{items}`: A single-line list of all cargo items, e.g., `Gold (10) Silver (5)`.
-   `{items_multiline}`: A multi-line list of all cargo items.
-   `\n`: Inserts a newline character.

**Default format:** `{count_slash_capacity} | {items}`

### Output File Name

You can change the name of the output file (default is `cargo.txt`).

### Output Directory

You can specify the folder where the output file will be saved. By default, it is saved in an `out` sub-folder. You can type a path directly or use the **Browse...** button to open a folder selection dialog.
